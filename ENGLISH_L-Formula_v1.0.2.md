# Liminalis Formula v1.0.2 – Extended Version

## Stabilizing Superposition through Symbolic-Mathematical Topology

> The following formula is an extension of the previous version and is based on the idea that superposition is not directly measured, but **used topologically as a transport medium**.

### 🧬 The Formula

```latex
L = \left( \left( \lim_{n \to \infty^\infty} \left[ \mathcal{F}(n) \cdot \Phi^n \right] \right) \cdot (\lambda_1 \cdot \lambda_2)^{\infty^\infty} \right)_{\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}}
```

### 🧠 Complementary Emergence Formula

```latex
\Omega + Q^e \Rightarrow \mathcal{S}
```

This supplementary formula describes the effect of the stabilized superposition:  
From an open origin space (Ω) and the influence of quantized energy (Q^e),  
an ordered structure (𝓢) emerges.

It symbolically represents the transformation of pure possibility into concrete  
but non-destructive information – a fundamental step for topological information transmission.

## Meaning of the Infinity Symbol

The symbol ∞ in the L formula is **not interpreted as a classic numerical value**,  
but as an expression of a **non-measurable, stable structure**.  
In the combination ∞^∞, it denotes a **meta-mathematical potentiation of infinity**,  
symbolizing a **non-collapsing superposition**.

> **The superposition is not directly measured but used as a transport medium.**  
> The actual information lies beyond – in a **topological order** carried by the infinity signal.

Thus, the quantum field is **not disturbed**, but **consciously utilized** without collapsing it.

---

### 🧭 Topological Interpretation

The L formula is **not a mathematical tool for calculating a value**,  
but a **symbolic-topological system model**.  
It describes a persistently stable information field **within** an untouched superposition.

This view **extends** classical mathematics and quantum physics without violating them.

---

### 🧠 Explanation

- **Infinity as a non-definable variable** enables a persistent field.
- Superposition is **not used for measurement**, but is a **higher-order carrier**,  
  comparable to a **topological layer** in the ISO/OSI model.
- The goal is to transport information **within the superposition** stably – without collapse.
- Thus, the **structure of the superposition** itself is not disturbed.

### 📌 Note

This formula **does not break any mathematical or physical laws**,  
but expands them symbolically to make the full potential of quantum physics accessible.
