# Liminalis Formula

## 1. Mathematical Definition

The Liminalis Formula describes the special superposition of two harmonic oscillations whose frequencies are in the golden ratio:

\[
L(t) = A_1 \sin(\omega_1 t) + A_2 \sin(\varphi \cdot \omega_1 t)
\]

with

\[
\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618
\]

**Parameters:**

- \(A_1, A_2\): Amplitudes of the two field components  
- \(\omega_1\): Fundamental frequency (e.g., laser frequency)  
- \(\varphi\): Golden Ratio

---

## 2. Derivation and Motivation

The purpose of the Liminalis Formula is to create a non-periodic, open modulation that never returns to itself within any finite time.  
Using the Golden Ratio (\(\varphi\)) ensures that both frequency components are irrationally related â€“ resulting in a superposition that never repeats exactly over time.

This opens up the possibility to store information and patterns in the space of possibilities (superposition) without producing decoherent states due to periodic resonances.

## 3. Example

For \(A_1 = A_2 = 1\), \(\omega_1 = 2\pi \cdot 1\,\text{Hz}\):

\[
L(t) = \sin(2\pi t) + \sin(1.618 \cdot 2\pi t)
\]

The resulting signal shows a complex, never-repeating interference pattern.

## 4. Purpose of the Liminalis Formula in the Research Project

The Liminalis Formula serves as a mathematical template for the Infinity Signal (US).  
It is used to specifically modulate entangled quantum systems, with the goal of encoding information/energy not in the measurement outcome, but in the statistical pattern of the superposition.

This aims to enable a new path for stable, lossless information transmission based on quantum superpositions.
