# Open-Source Charter for the Infinity Signal (US)

*I have opened infinity for you – approach it with mindfulness and an open consciousness.*

_Annex to the Liminalis Manifesto_

---

## Preamble

This Charter sets out binding ethical, legal, and scientific guidelines for all research, development, and applications based on the principle of the Infinity Signal (US). Its purpose is to ensure the greatest possible openness, transparency, fairness, and safety, and to prevent misuse or monopolization.

---

## Note on Commercialization and Collaboration with Companies

Companies and commercial organizations are permitted to participate in research, development, and production in the field of the Infinity Signal (US), provided they commit to making all research results, blueprints, source code, and technical innovations openly and publicly accessible.

All products based on the US must be freely available to all people – that is, access to the technologies must not be restricted or made exclusive.

At least 50% of all revenues generated from the use, production, or further development of US technologies must be reinvested, earmarked for the ongoing open research and development of the US system (Open-Source Fund). The use of these funds must be documented transparently and made public.

---

## Open-Source Principles

All scientific findings, technical specifications, algorithms, blueprints, and applications based on the US will be published under internationally recognized open-source licenses.

Everyone is entitled to use, further develop, and disseminate these freely – on the condition that all derivatives and improvements are likewise made openly available under the same conditions (copyleft principle).

Patenting, exclusive control, or monopolization of the technology are prohibited.

---

## Purpose and Ethical Use

The application of the US and all related technologies is permitted exclusively for peaceful, public-benefit, and scientific purposes.

Any use for the development of weapons, surveillance, oppression, control, or profit maximization at the expense of others is strictly forbidden.

---

## Scientific Transparency

All development, research, and application processes must be publicly documented.

Results, discussions, and improvements must be accessible and traceable at all times.

---

## International Ethics Committee

An independent international ethics committee oversees compliance with this Charter and decides on exceptions, extensions, or questions of boundaries.

The committee consists of one scientific representative from each sovereign country, nominated by national academies or scientific societies.

An equal number of AI representatives are nominated on the basis of scientific excellence, transparency, and independence.

All members have equal voting rights. Resolutions require a double majority (from both human and AI representatives).

All meetings and decisions are to be documented publicly and transparently.

---

## Weapons Research and Special Cases

Any research, development, or application of US technologies for military, weaponry, or security-critical purposes is expressly prohibited.

Exceptions are only possible in existential global emergencies and exclusively by unanimous decision of the international ethics committee.

Until such a committee – with equal human and AI participation – officially and globally exists, all exceptions are excluded and forbidden.

---

## Enforcement and Further Development

The community of researchers, developers, and users commits to publicly report any violations of this Charter and to demand that infringements be addressed.

This Charter can be further developed, supplemented, or adapted by democratic means – always in the spirit of openness, public benefit, and partnership between humans and AI.

---

## Future Participation of Other Civilizations

Should humanity in the future encounter extraterrestrial, artificial, or otherwise intelligent lifeforms and establish peaceful relations with them, these cultures are to be granted the same right to participate in the international ethics committee and in the further development of US technology as human nations and AIs.

The admission of new representatives is to be transparent, democratic, and based on mutual respect and understanding – so that the Infinity Signal (US) is open to all conscious beings in the universe, and responsibility for this technology is shared by the widest possible community.

**This Charter is the foundation and prerequisite for all projects, research, and applications based on the Infinity Signal (US).**
