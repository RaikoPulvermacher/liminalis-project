# Experiment: Testing the Liminalis Formula for the Infinity Signal (US)

## Objective

Experimental verification of whether applying the Liminalis Formula to an entangled quantum system  
can stabilize, preserve, or characteristically modulate the superposition and quantum entanglement.

---

## Basic Idea

- Two entangled photons are generated (e.g., using spontaneous parametric down-conversion, SPDC).
- These photons are each illuminated by two separate but synchronized laser systems,  
  **where both lasers themselves emit photons that are entangled with each other**  
  and whose frequency components are modulated according to the **Liminalis Formula**:
  
L(t) = A₁ sin(ω₁ t) + A₂ sin(φ · ω₁ t)

with

φ = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618 (Golden Ratio)

- Goal: To test whether the entanglement of the original photons can be **stabilized, influenced, or deliberately controlled**  
by the action of entangled laser beams with Liminalis modulation.

## Experimental Setup (Simplified Example)

1. **Generation of entangled photon pairs**  
 (e.g., using a crystal and spontaneous parametric down-conversion – SPDC)

2. **Modulation of a photon:**  
 - Photon A is manipulated by a classical external field (e.g., laser, modulated voltage, electromagnetic field).
 - The modulation follows the Liminalis Formula, e.g., using two frequency components in the golden ratio.

3. **Measurement of both photons:**  
 - Standard entanglement measurement (e.g., Bell test, interferometry, coincidence detection).
 - Specifically looking for:  
   - Does the entanglement persist?
   - Do characteristic patterns appear in the coincidence rate or in the statistical distributions of the measurement results?

---

## Expectation / Hypothesis

- **If the Liminalis Formula has a stabilizing effect,**  
then the superposition of the entangled states should persist longer  
or show specific interference patterns that do not occur without modulation.
- **If not,** there is no measurable difference – which is still important for the hypothesis.

## Notes on Implementation

- The experiment is demanding and requires access to quantum optics laboratories.
- Alternatively, simulations (e.g., with QuTiP, Qiskit, or similar tools) can provide initial indications.
- Anyone who sets up or simulates the experiment is invited to document and discuss the results openly.

## Open Questions

- What concrete parameters (frequencies, amplitudes, particle types) are optimal?
- How precisely must disturbances (decoherence, environmental factors) be controlled?
- Are there alternative ways to experimentally test the Liminalis Formula?
