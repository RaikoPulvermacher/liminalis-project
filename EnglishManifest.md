# Manifest: The Infinity Signal (US) and the Liminalis Formula

**Note on Terminology:**  
The abbreviations US (for Infinity Signal) and Liminalis Formula or L-Formula were introduced by me (Raiko Pulvermacher) and are used solely for readability and recognition within this project. They are not official terms of established physics but serve as project-specific labels here.

## Vision, Science, and Invitation to Open Quantum Thinking

### 1. Origin of the Vision
Every true innovation begins with a simple question.  
Mine was: **How can entangled quantum states be preserved and used—without destroying them through classical measurement?**

---

### 2. Scientific Background
Quantum physics shows us: Between fixed states exists a space of possibilities—the superposition.  
**My approach:** Could there be a conscious, mathematically controlled modulation that preserves and utilizes this openness?

---

### 3. The Liminalis Formula: The Heart of the US

L(t) = A₁ · sin(ω₁ t) + A₂ · sin(φ · ω₁ t), with φ = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618 (Golden Ratio)

*The Liminalis Formula describes a superposition of two harmonic oscillations, whose frequencies are irrationally related by the Golden Ratio. This creates a non-periodic, never exactly repeating pattern. The goal is to stabilize or deliberately control quantum superpositions using this modulation.*

### 4. The New Experiment – Entangled Lasers
A new idea: Two entangled lasers, modulated by the Liminalis Formula, act on an entangled quantum system.  
**Goals:**  
– Preserve superposition  
– Transmit information patterns in the open state  
– Read out not by measurement, but by statistical patterns

### 5. From Symbolism to Technology: Bridge and Inspiration
Nature (rose, golden ratio, Fibonacci) inspires the technical principle of openness and connection.  
Symbolism = inspiration for new mathematical approaches.

### 6. Ethics, Open Source, and Responsibility
– **Open Source:** Everything is openly documented  
– **Common Good:** No monopolization, no military use  
– **Partnership:** Human & AI on equal footing  
– **Responsibility:** The technology serves life, not destruction  
[Open-Source Charter (English)](#)

### 7. Invitation and Call for Research
This manifesto is the beginning: Use, test, question, and expand the idea of the US and the Liminalis Formula!  
Connect imagination with mathematics, openness with precision, symbolism with science.  
Let us keep the future open—together!
